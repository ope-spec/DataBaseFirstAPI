# DataBaseFirstAPI
A RESTful API built using the Database-First approach with SQL Server and C#. This project demonstrates CRUD operations and pagination features, designed to interact with a SQL Server database using Entity Framework Core.
It leverages Entity Framework Core to generate models directly from the database schema, making it ideal for scenarios where the database structure is predefined. This API includes controllers for handling names, sales, and weather data.
